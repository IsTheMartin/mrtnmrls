description: Starting this great adventure where I can share a little bit about me to the world.

I spend some time writing about my thoughts, experiences or anything that catches my attention. I have created a digital garden to house these notes and I enjoy reading them occasionally.

I strongly believe in sharing knowledge, as well as experiences and ideas. The content is what matters, not how it is presented. I think this project will help me at some point in my life. As someone once said: _Whoever does not know their story is condemned to repeat it_.

This project motivated me to improve my writing skills and learn how to develop a web project, which is my first time doing this kind of project. The main goal of this new adventure is share posts about my thoughts and experiences.

The idea is to be natural or attempt to be natural; I don't want to create a journal where I update every day because that would be forced upon me. I hope the posts aren't too longâ€”at most, two or three minutes to read.

I hold a small hope that this project will serve as a bridge to connect with others and forge a bond outside of traditional social media networks. I hope it turns out that way.

Finally, I would like to thank [Manu](https://manuelmoreale.com) for being a great inspiration.
