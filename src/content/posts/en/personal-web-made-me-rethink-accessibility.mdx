description: Accessibility on the web, what we have done to include those with different abilities.

I've been developing software (mainly android apps) for over than five years, but also I consumed wide range of software, including web, webapps, native apps or embedded. Many of these digital solutions are developed with the latest technologies.
<br/>
However two years ago I received a feedback regarding a bug discovered in a form with numerous input text fields. There is not a problem when the development is focused to touch screens; you can use virtual keyboard in those devices and you can configure focus behavior on fields by using [ImeAction](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/text/input/ImeAction).
<br/>
Then I met with QA team, who told me: what if the user has a non-touch screen? what is the focus behavior of those input fields when there is not a digital keyboard?. Accessibility was the first thing that came to mind for me, even though I had never considered it.
<br/>
I implemented a solution to that bug and in response to these questions, I'm attempting to follow the best practices for accessibility, particularly the visual aspect.
<br/>
I recently discovered a website that describes [how people with visual diseases perceive colors on websites](https://www.whocanuse.com). This resource is interesting and impactful to me because it shows how certain colors and combinations affect presentation of the content to people with visual diseases.
<br/>
In recent years, we have focused on creating and launching products for a social sector that promotes inclusion and color. But what about those who have always been there? Those who are often overlooked because they have different qualities and want to have a voice in this world. What can we offer them?
<br/>
In conclusion, *A highly interactive or colorful site web or app is not synonymous with accessibility*.
