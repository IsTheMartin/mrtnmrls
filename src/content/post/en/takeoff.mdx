I spend some time writing about my thoughts, experiences or anything that catches my attention. I have created a digital garden to house these notes and I enjoy reading them occasionally.
<br />
I strongly believe in sharing knowledge, as well as experiences and ideas. The content is what matters, not how it is presented. I think this project will help me at some point in my life. As someone once said: _Whoever does not know their story is condemned to repeat it_.
<br />
This project motivated me to improve my writing skills and learn how to develop a web project, which is my first time doing this kind of project. The main goal of this new adventure is share posts about my thoughts and experiences.
<br />
The idea is to be natural or attempt to be natural; I don't want to create a journal where I update every day because that would be forced upon me. I hope the posts aren't too longâ€”at most, two or three minutes to read.
<br />
I hold a small hope that this project will serve as a bridge to connect with others and forge a bond outside of traditional social media networks. I hope it turns out that way.
<br />
Finally, I would like to thank [Manu](https://manuelmoreale.com) for being a great inspiration.
