    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      This website does not have a track tool for analytics currently and I'm
      not interested to implement them.
    </p>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      This website is cookie-free, so you shouldn't see any offensive messages
      about accepting or rejecting cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've used the online tool <a href="https://www.cookiemetrix.com/"
        >Cookie Metrix</a
      > to verify.
    </p>

    <h2>Terms of service</h2>
    <p>
      Many complex websites now offer services that require you to be signed up
      for. It's not necessary on this site because I don't offer any services to
      access, view, read, or copy the content.
    </p>
    <h2>License information</h2>
    <p>
      All the content is under the license <b
        ><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"
          >CC BY-SA 4.0</a
        ></b
      >, this means:
      <ul>
        <li>
          You are free to share, copy and redistribute the material in any
          medium or format.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are also free to adapt, remix, transform, and build upon the
          material for any purpose, even commercially. However ...
        </li>
        <li>
          You must provide attribution to the author (me) with a link back to
          this website. An example attribution is below.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must
          distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally
          restrict others from doing anything the license permits.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Attribution Example</h3>
    <p>
      An acceptable attribution that complies with the license would be
      something similar to the following:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-html">
          &lt;p&gt;Credits to &lt;a href="https://mrtnmrls.com"&gt;Mart√≠n Morales&lt;/a&gt; for original content.&lt;/p&gt;
